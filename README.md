## üß† How It Works

### AI-Powered Pill Identification
1. User uploads a photo of a pill
2. Image is processed using TensorFlow.js on the client side
3. The system identifies the pill based on shape, color, and markings
4. Drug information is retrieved from a medical database
5. Results are displayed to the user with safety information

### Symptom Checker Flow
1. User describes their symptoms through a chat interface
2. Natural Language Processing (NLP) extracts key symptoms
3. AI compares symptoms against a medical knowledge base
4. System provides possible conditions and recommended actions
5. Option to book a consultation if needed

### Payment Integration
1. User selects a plan (Free, Basic, or Pro)
2. For paid plans, user enters payment details
3. IntaSend processes the payment via M-Pesa or card
4. On successful payment, user gains access to premium features
5. Receipt and subscription details are stored in Supabase

## üéØ Hackathon Focus Areas

### Problem Statement
Access to affordable and reliable healthcare information and services remains a significant challenge in many African communities. Plexus Care addresses this by providing:
- **Accessibility**: Mobile-first platform for users with limited connectivity
- **Affordability**: Free basic features with affordable premium options
- **Education**: Empowering users with reliable health information

### Innovation
- **AI-Powered Triage**: Reduces unnecessary hospital visits
- **Localized Solutions**: Built with African healthcare challenges in mind
- **Offline-First**: Functions in areas with poor connectivity

## üìä Technical Implementation

### Database Schema
```sql
-- Users table
create table users (
  id uuid references auth.users not null primary key,
  full_name text,
  avatar_url text,
  subscription_tier text default 'free',
  trial_ends_at timestamp with time zone,
  created_at timestamp with time zone default timezone('utc'::text, now()) not null
);

-- Consultations table
create table consultations (
  id uuid default uuid_generate_v4() primary key,
  user_id uuid references users(id) not null,
  doctor_id uuid references users(id),
  symptoms text,
  diagnosis text,
  status text default 'scheduled',
  scheduled_for timestamp with time zone,
  created_at timestamp with time zone default timezone('utc'::text, now()) not null
);
```

### API Endpoints
- `POST /api/identify-pill` - Process pill images
- `POST /api/check-symptoms` - Analyze symptoms
